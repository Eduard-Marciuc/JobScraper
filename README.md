# Royal Road WebScraper
A web scraper that downloads text files of RoyalRoad chapters every 3 seconds (RR ToS specify no scraping faster that what a human could achieve, so courtesy delay as not sure of specifics.)
Simply create a file named `readinglist.txt` and add your books in the form of `Name,LinkOnRoyalRoad`, with the link leading to the main contents page of that story. Then run scraper and it will start to download the files. If the story releases new chapters, run the scraper again and only the new chapters will be downloaded.
